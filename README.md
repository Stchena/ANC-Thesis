# Prototype of an Active Noise Control System - Thesis
This is my Bachelor of Engineering Thesis!

For this, I built a prototype of an Active Noise Control System (Feedforward-Feedback approach) using the STM32F446RE microcontroller.

The thesis alone is in Polish - not really gonna translate that, but you can view the code, where the comments are in English.
